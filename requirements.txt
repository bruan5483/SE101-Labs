Requirements for the triangle program:
1. The program accepts six command-line arguments representing the 
   Cartesian coordinates of three points in the form 'x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3'.
2. On completion the program outputs the coordinates of the three points and 
   the area of the triangle formed by the three points.
3. If the user provides fewer than six arguments, the program exits with an
   error message indicating that 6 arguments are required and outputs the 
   number of arguments received.
4. If the user provides more than six arguments, the program exits with an
   error message indicating that 6 arguments are required and outputs the 
   number of arguments received.
5. If the user provides a non-integer argument, the program exits with an 
   error message indicating that integer inputs are required, and outputs 
   the position of the first non-integer argument.
